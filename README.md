# UptimeD

Daemon for monitoring docker and pm2 services which do not expose internet accesible ports for uptime kuma.  
Finds the service by name and calls the push url.

## Setup

Too lazy to setup a docker image, run under pm2 lol.  
Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill in the necessary values.
